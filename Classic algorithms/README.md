## Classic algorithms

**Collatz Conjecture** - Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

**Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

**Closest pair problem** - The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given n points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.

**Sieve of Eratosthenes** - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).
**Backtracking** : Learn backtracking is a efficent way to learn how to build games like soduku and help u in solving many many problems.
**Brute force** : A brute force algorithms is a way to devlop to find less bugs in the way and make sure that the code  passes through all the given test
